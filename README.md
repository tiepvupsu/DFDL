## Usage
* To start the software, please run the script `DFDL_start.m`
* The main files implementing the algorithms are `DFDL.m`

## Sample dataset 
A _reduced_ version of ADL-Kidney dataset could be downloaded from:
    http://signal.ee.psu.edu/dfdl/ADL_Kidney_reduce.zip

## Requirements 
This version of DFDL has only been tested on MATLAB R2011a or later and all of 
our testing was done on the Windows 7 platform.
